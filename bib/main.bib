  abstract = {Abstract Consider a simple random walk on a connected graph G=(V,‚ÄâE). Let C(u,‚Äâv) be the expected time taken for the walk starting at vertex u to reach vertex v and then go back to u again, i.e., the commute time for u and v, and let C(G)=maxu,‚Äâv‚ààVC(u,‚Äâv). Further, let ùí¢(n,‚Äâm) be the family of connected graphs on n vertices with m edges, \$m\in\{n-1,\ldots,{n\choose2}\}\$, and let ùí¢(n)=‚à™mùí¢(n,‚Äâm) be the family of all connected n-vertex graphs. It is proved that if G‚àà(n,‚Äâm) is such that C(G)=maxH‚ààùí¢(n,‚Äâm)C(H) then G is either a lollipop graph or a so-called double-handled lollipop graph. It is further shown, using this result, that if C(G)=maxH‚ààùí¢(n)C(H) then G is the full lollipop graph or a full double-handled lollipop graph with [(2n‚àí1)/3] vertices in the clique unless n‚â§9 in which case G is the n-path.‚ÄÉ¬©2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.‚ÄÉRandom Struct.

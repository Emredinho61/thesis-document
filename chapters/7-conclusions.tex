The Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum algorithm proves to be a compromise solution between the Push-Pull Sum and Single-Proposal Deal-Agreement-Based algorithms. The simulation results show that the Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum algorithm performs well in dense graphs as well as in regular low-degree graphs. Especially for the Ring of Cliques $ROC_{32,32}$ and $ROC_{8,128}$ as well as for Lollipop $L_{512,512}$ and $L_{896,128}$ topologies, the ATPPS algorithm proved to be the best solution, as the algorithm achieved the lowest MSE values after 100 rounds of simulation. The Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum achieved good overall results. In cases where the PPS failed to show good balancing abilities, like in the $ROC_{32,32}$, the Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum proved to be very efficient, achieving results close to the Deal-Agreement-Based algorithm. In cases where the Push-Pull Sum algorithm achieved lower MSE within 100 rounds, the difference to the Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum algorithm was not significant as seen for the Complete graph $K_{1024}$, Star graph $S_{1024}$, Lollipop graph $L_{128,896}$, as well as the Torus Grid $T_{32,32}$. However, when the Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum outperforms the traditional Push-Pull Sum algorithm, the MSE discrepancies are more significant, like in the case of Ring of Cliques $ROC_{32,32}$ and $ROC_{128,8}$. The Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum algorithm manages to distribute loads efficiently by adaptively adapting to the network state; this was particularly evident in the $ROC_{32,32}$ and $ROC_{128,8}$ structures. When the load differences within the cliques were no longer significant enough, clique-to-clique communication via the bridging nodes was favored. The Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum algorithm also achieves the sharpest downward trend for $K_{1024}$ until the curve finally stagnates. No improvement of the load balancing behavior was observed for the Ring $R_{1024}$ structure; the reason for this is that each node has exactly 2 neighbors, and thus the condition $\log_{2}{(|neighbourhood|)}=$ evaluates exactly one and thus acts very similar to the traditional Push-Pull Sum algorithm, without prioritizing any nodes. Also for the Star topology, the Adaptive Threshold does not achieve any advantage over the traditional Push-Pull Sum algorithm, as the leaf nodes all communicate with the central node; however, the condition with significant load transfers limits the number of requests to the central node compared to the traditional Push-Pull Sum algorithm. The result: the Push-Pull Sum achieves a balanced state of the network earlier. Compared to the Push-Pull Sum algorithms, the Single-Proposal Deal-Agreement-Based algorithm has problems with dense graphs, such as the Complete graph, Lollipop graph with a large clique size, and Ring of Cliques with a large clique size. The MSE differences in the 100th round are extremely large because the MSE differences for low-degree topologies such as the Ring graph and the Torus Grid graph are not as significant. The Adaptive Threshold Push-Pull Sum is localized by the MSE between the other two algorithms, closer to the best-performing Deal-Agreement-Based algorithm than to the traditional Push-Pull Sum algorithm. The simulation results depend mainly on the sensibility factor $k$. A large $k$ ensures a more sensitive selection of neighbors, while a smaller $k$ allows a coarser selection of neighbors.
